        <h1>Italy </h1>
        <p>Italy is a country in southern Europe, located on the Italian 
            Peninsula and extending into the Mediterranean Sea. It is bordered
             by France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia to the north and 
             shares maritime borders with several countries across the Adriatic,
              Ionian, and Tyrrhenian Seas. Italy includes the islands of 
              Sicily and Sardinia, along with many smaller islands, and spans a
               total area of 301,340 square kilometers (116,350 sq mi). 
               The country is divided into 20 regions, five of which have 
               special autonomous status. Approximately 35% of Italy’s land
                is mountainous, with the Alps to the north and the Apennines
                 running down the center. Much of its population resides in 
                 urban centers and coastal regions. With a population of about 
                 58 million as of 2025, Italy is the third most populous country in the European Union. The capital and largest city is Rome, historically known as the heart of the Roman 
            Empire and now a major global cultural and political center.</p>
