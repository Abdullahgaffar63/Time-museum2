        <h1>South-Korea</h1>
        <p>South Korea consists of over 4,000 islands, each with its own unique story and history. Not long ago, South Korea was a
        small, developing nation closed off to much of the world. However, these days, that is rapidly changing, and it is
        considered one of the most popular tourist destinations due to its rich history and fantastic food scene (among other
        things).
        
        South Korea has been getting an increasing amount of publicity around the world. In East Asia, there is a lot about
        K-pop, cosmetics, and Korean dramas. In the West, people often hear news about their neighbors up North (although that’s
        changing too, thanks to the Korean wave).
        
        People worldwide hear about South Korea’s love for plastic surgery. These factors have led to a greater interest in
        South Korea and studying Korean.
        
        Without further ado, here are the most interesting things about South Korea!.</p>

        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>South Korea boasts about its colorful culture, from Hanok, Hanbok, and Hangeul down to their practices. A few
        interesting things you may want to know about the culture in South Korea are the usage of titles and names and their age
        system.
        
        Both of these are unique to Korea, so they may be different from your culture.
        
        Korean Titles
        One of the most interesting fun facts about South Korea that often confuses people is when to use names or titles.
        Culture in South Korea is very hierarchical, and much of it is based on age.
        
        Only in specific situations are you allowed to call someone by their first name. Otherwise, you need to refer to them by
        title. This can be somewhat confusing at the workplace, especially if you’re managing someone older than you.
        
        This is also the case for home and family life. Getting the titles right is critical and can be a point of strife if
        family members don’t recognize rank.
        
        The good news is that these situations make for great drama storylines. Just when you thought that discovering your
        long-lost twin brother while battling through amnesia wasn’t enough, you get some bonus conflict!
