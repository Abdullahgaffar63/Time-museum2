        <h1>Egypt </h1>
        <p>Egypt is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of
             Africa and the southwest corner of Asia via the Sinai Peninsula. 
             It is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Red Sea to the east, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Egypt covers a total area of 1,002,450 square kilometers (387,050 sq mi), making it the third-largest country in 
             Africa. The country is divided into 27 governorates and features a predominantly desert landscape, with the vast majority of its population living along the fertile Nile River valley and delta, which accounts for only a small fraction of its land area. As of 2025, Egypt has a population of over 110 million, making it the most populous country in the Arab world. The capital and largest city is Cairo, a 
            historic metropolis and one of the largest urban areas in Africa.</p>

        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>Egyptian culture bridges ancient civilization and modern Arab identity, influenced by African, Mediterranean, and Islamic traditions. Its artistic heritage includes hieroglyphic inscriptions, stone carving, Islamic architecture, and folk crafts such as pottery, weaving, and inlay. Egypt's performing arts include Arabic music, traditional storytelling,
             belly dancing, and contemporary cinema, with Cairo known as the cultural capital of the Arab world. Cultural practices include lavish weddings, religious festivals like Eid and Ramadan, and local folklore. Egypt has invested in safeguarding its archaeological treasures and intangible heritage. With seven UNESCO 
            World Heritage Sites, including both ancient and Islamic landmarks,
             Egypt holds a unique place in global heritage. It continues to
             influence Arabic literature, television, and regional popular culture.</p>
