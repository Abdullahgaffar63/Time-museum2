        <h1>China</h1>
        <p>
            China, an ancient, mysterious and beautiful land, is always appealing to adventurous foreign visitors. As the third
            largest country in the world occupying an area of 9,600,000 sq km, it spans 62 degrees of longitude and 49 degrees of
            latitude. A wide variety of terrain and climate shape its numerous natural attractions. Abundant in a variety of
            resources, plants, animals, and minerals, the land has nurtured countless generations of Chinese people.
            <br>
            One of China's greatest treasures is her long, rich history. As early as 1.7 million years ago, the earliest humans
            evolved on this land. The first dynasty, the Xia Dynasty, dates to about the 21st century BC. For 4,000 years, feudalism
            was the dominant economic and cultural model. Then, in 1911, the revolution led by Sun Yat-sen brought the monarchy to
            an end. On October 1st, 1949, PRC was founded, fully named the 'People's Republic of China'. Since then, this country
            has developed independently and vigorously. Most recently, reform and opening-up policy has energized life in this
            country.
            
            China is proud of her many people, long history, resplendent culture and distinctive customs. Among her greatest gifts
            to the world are the 'four great inventions' (paper, gunpowder, printing and the compass) .
            
            Chinese arts and crafts, including painting, calligraphy, operas, embroidery and silk are distinctive and unique. Kung
            Fu, which have only recently begun to enjoy popularity in other parts of the world have been part of Chinese culture for
            centuries, and Chinese literature is testifies to the country's rich heritage. And, of course, there is Chinese food,
            which has been exported to every corner of the globe.

        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>
            One of the most widely-known Chinese culture facts is the <mark>strong emphasis on filial piety</mark>. Children are expected to
            always respect, honor, and take care of their parents. 
            What’s more, the concept of honoring your ancestors has a deep intertwinement with Chinese culture. So much so that
            “对得起祖先” — to be able to face your ancestors, is a common phrase used to dissuade individuals from partaking in taboo and
            immoral activities.
            <br>
            Another common fact about Chinese culture is the concept of <mark>“saving face” </mark>— presenting one’s self in a way that avoids
            embarrassing or bringing shame to one’s self, one’s family, or someone else.
            There isn’t a set threshold of what exactly is considered “shameful” and is really based more on societal norms and
            constructs. For example, one Chinese family may consider the fact that their child is failing at school to be shameful
            while another might not feel the need to hide it.
        
            <br>
            <mark> The manners of receiving and giving gifts</mark>
            In Chinese culture and tradition, receiving and giving something to and from someone with both hands indicates respect
            and humility. On the other hand, using just one hand is sometimes considered rude, especially when you’re receiving
            something from someone older.
            If you’re receiving or giving something which isn’t practical to hold with both hands, you may use your right hand, and
            place your left hand slightly above your right wrist.

        <h2>TO VISIT</h2>
        <p>
        China, a captivating blend of history and natural beauty, beckons travelers with its incredible destinations.
        From ancient wonders to modern marvels, there is no shortage of incredible places to explore in this vast nation.
       <b> Beijing: See Imperial China</b>
        If I could only pick one city for your first trip to China or the first stop on your China journey, I would definitely
        choose Beijing.
        Not just because it's the capital, but because it offers the best window into China's rich history, culture, and
        architectural styles.
        From iconic landmarks like the Great Wall, Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, to the Summer Palace, Beijing brings the
        past to life.
        <b>Shanghai: See Modern China</b>
        If you want to see the most modern and international side of China without losing the sense of culture, Shanghai is a
        must-visit.
        To experience the city's dazzling skyline at night, a Huangpu River cruise is one of the best options. As the cruise
        glides along the river, you'll see the futuristic skyline on one side and the historic Bund with its century-old
        buildings on the other. The contrast of lights and architecture is truly breathtaking.
      <b>Zhangjiajie: See Scenic China</b>
        If you want to see some of China's most extraordinary natural landscapes, Zhangjiajie is easily one of the top choices
        Its most famous site is the "Avatar Mountains" in Zhangjiajie National Forest Park, known for its towering sandstone
        peaks and mist. It truly feels like stepping into a surreal world.
