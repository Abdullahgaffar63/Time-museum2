        <h1>Pakistan</h1>
        <p>Pakistan is a country in South Asia, located at the crossroads of Central Asia and the Middle East. It 
            shares borders with India to the east, Afghanistan and Iran to the west, China to the north, and the 
            Arabian Sea to the south. Covering an area of 881,913 square kilometers (340,509 sq mi), it is the 
            33rd-largest country in the world. Pakistan is administratively divided 
            into four provinces, two autonomous territories, and one federal territory. 
            The country features diverse geography, including 
            mountain ranges in the north, fertile plains in the east, and 
            arid plateaus and deserts in the south and west. Around 63% of its 
            population lives in rural areas, though major urban 
            centers are rapidly growing. With a population exceeding 245 milli
            on as of 2025, Pakistan is the fifth most populous country in the world. The capital city \
            is Islamabad, while Karachi is the largest city and economic hub.</p>

        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>Pakistani culture is a rich tapestry shaped by South Asian, Central Asian, Persian, and Islamic
             influences. Traditional arts include intricate embroidery, truck art, 
            calligraphy, pottery, and carpet weaving. Music and performance 
            arts feature classical forms like qawwali and ghazals, as well 
            as regional folk dances and storytelling. Cultural practices such as
             Mehndi ceremonies, religious celebrations, poetry recitals,
             and tea culture are widely observed. Pakistan has a growing film 
            and media industry (Lollywood), and cricket plays a unifying role in
             popular life. The country recognizes its cultural heritage through 
            institutions and heritage sites, with six locations inscribed on 
            the UNESCO World Heritage List. As a multilingual and multiethnic 
            society, Pakistan’s cultural identity is both diverse and dynamic.</p>
