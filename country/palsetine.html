        <h1>PALESTINE</h1>
        <p>
            
            <br>
        Palestine, with its rich tapestry of civilisations and tumultuous history, stands at the intersection of Asia, Africa,
        and Europe. This region, cradled by the Mediterranean Sea to the west and the Jordan River to the east, has been a
        melting pot of cultural, religious, and political developments for millennia.
        
        Its strategic significance has drawn countless peoples and empires to its land, each leaving an indelible mark on the
        historical narrative of this place. From ancient Canaanites to modern-day Israelis and Palestinians, the land has
        witnessed a complex saga of settlement, conquest, and conflict, making it a focal point for understanding human
        civilisation’s diversity and the enduring quest for identity and sovereignty. Let’s delve into the historical journey of
        Palestine and explore the myriad of cultures and events that have shaped its story from the dawn of civilisation to the
        present day.
        Ancient history
            The history of Palestine is as ancient as the dawn of civilisation itself. Archaeological evidence reveals that this
            land was inhabited by prehistoric peoples, who left traces of their existence through artefacts and ruins. By the Bronze
            Age, the Canaanites emerged as the dominant culture, establishing city-states and developing trade networks that
            connected them with the larger Near Eastern and Mediterranean worlds. These early inhabitants faced invasions and
            domination by ancient superpowers, including the Egyptians, Assyrians, and Babylonians, each contributing to the
            region’s rich cultural mosaic.
            This period also saw the emergence of the Israelite kingdom, a development that has had a lasting religious and
            historical significance. The complex interplay of local and foreign powers during these millennia set the stage for the
            diverse and contested history that would continue to characterise the region.

        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>
            The Culture of Palestine is closely related to those of its nearby countries such as Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan. The
            major aspects of Palestinian Society and Culture include: customs, religion, language, literature, art, costume and
            music of the land and its inhabitants
            <br>
            Palestinian Cuisine
            The favorite Palestine foods include: bread, meat, cheese, rice, sauces, soups and desserts. Herbs and spices play a
            very important role in Palestine food. Accompanying every mouth-watering dish there are choices of beverages including:
            coffee, tea, orange Juice, Limonada and many more.
            Languages Spoken in Palestine
            The languages that are mostly spoken in Palestine are of course Arabic, some English and a smaller amount of Hebrew.
            Arabic has many dialects and the dialect spoken in Palestine comes from the subgroup of Levantine Arabic. Modern
            Standard Arabic is used throughout the Arab world and will also be understood in Palestine.
            Religions in Palestine
            The major religions practiced in Palestine are of course Islam, plus Christianity and to a lesser extent, Judaism. The
            Sunni Muslims are the predominant Muslims living in Palestine.
            <br>
            Palestine customs and conventions are closely related to those of its neighboring countries of Lebanon, Jordan, Syria
            and other countries of the Arab world.
            Palestinian culture is a rich array of contrasts from western culture and it is unique and impressive. Palestinian
            people are well known for being incredibly hospitable, where you might be invited to have a tea or coffee with someone
            you have just met. Palestinians trust people very quickly and they enjoy meeting with internationals from all over the
            world and spending time with them. They are raised on the philosophy of taking care of their guests whoever they are and
            to make them feel comfortable as if they had known them for long time or as if they are part of the family.
            Palestinians are eager to show internationals Palestinian culture and engage with them in many different family and
            cultural activities, which will make your trip to Palestine full of amazing memories and enjoyable moments. Not only
            will they wish to show you Palestinian culture but also they are equally very keen to learn of other peoples’ cultures
            and get to know about their daily habits and how they spend their time.
           <mark> Palestinian culture </mark>is based on not only helping family members and neighbors but also passersby whoever that person may
            be. A Palestinian person will automatically offer any possible help that they can. Moreover and despite their differing
            views, Christians and Muslims live alongside one another, which lends a harmony to the entire area of Palestine. This
            harmony imbues Palestine with a special beauty. An example of this harmony is the site of the Church of the Nativity and
            the Mosque of Omar bin al-Khattab, both sharing the same location in Manger Square in the heart of Bethlehem city
            It is known that the Palestinian borders are fully controlled by Israel which decides who enters and who does not. Added
            to this, Palestine does not have its own airport. These two facts result in Palestine having less numbers of visitors
            compared to other countries that have control over their own borders, where visitors can visit more easily. Nonetheless,
            this makes Palestinians more eager to host internationals who come from different countries around the globe and they do
            so with open arms.
            During your time here, people who are eager to help you enjoy your journey to Palestine will surround you. You might
            hear them saying “Hello” or “Welcome to Palestine” or “How are you?” or help you to find what you are looking for, as a
            sign of hospitability and eagerness. They want to make sure that you feel totally comfortable and welcome on their land
            and among their people no matter from which country you come from.
            Visiting Palestine
            Visiting Palestine is an exceptional opportunity for you to meet Palestinian people, to live their daily life or to
            learn Palestinian Arabic, and to observe the Israeli-Palestinian conflict first-hand. Most importantly, it is an
            opportunity to significantly and positively influence the lives of Palestinians.
            As you have read above, living in Palestine is totally different from living in Europe, the USA, Asia, South America or
            Australia. Life in Palestine is characterized by intensive social interactions, a spontaneous life style (people and the
            way of doing things are not organized according to prearranged plans), hospitality, and an eagerness to know about
            others.
            It is incredibly easy to engage in Palestinian culture. Most international visitors adapt relatively easily to life in
            Palestine. Finally, we encourage you to arrive with an open mind, to be eager to learn, and to be motivated for
            engagement in Palestinian culture. We are sure you will have a wonderful and unforgettable stay in Palestine.

        <p>
            
            <b> Al-Aqsa Mosque</b>
            This is the Al-Aqsa Mosque or “the Farthest Mosque” which is located in the Old City of Jerusalem. Jews also sanctify
            the same place, and they claim that the mosque is built on the rubble of the Prophet Solomon’s Temple. Many of the
            extremist Jewish organizations used this argument to rebuild the temple, as they believed it was in earlier times.
            <b>The Dom of the Rock</b>
            The Dom of the rock is an octagonal building having four doors. It is part of Al-Aqsa Mosque and one of the holiest
            places for Muslims. It is the only ancient Islamic building that is preserved its shape and decoration. The name of the
            place comes from the Muslim belief that Muhammad was transported using the rock inside from the Sacred Mosque in Mecca,
            Saudi Arabia to al-Aqsa during the Night Journey. This rock rises one meter and a half from the earth’s surface.
            <b>Dead Sea</b>
            The Dead Sea is located from Jericho city, which is believed to be one of the oldest inhabited cities on earth. The Dead
            Sea is considered the top tourist attraction. It spans 50 km in length, and 15 km in width. It is the most saline sea on
            earth, and its salt concentration is seven times higher than the concentration of salt in the earth’s oceans. The sea
            contains mud filled with minerals and salts, which is renowned for its beneficial effects on the skin. It is also one of
            the richest types of clay.
            <b>Nablus</b>
            The Old City in Nablus has important sites going back from the 1st to 15th centuries. The Old City includes six major
            quarters: Yasmina; Gharb; Qaryun; Aqaba; Qaysariyya; and Habala. These quarters all have historical sites. In addition,
            the Old City has six hamaams (Turkish baths). Al-Shifa Hamaam was built 1624, and Al Hana Hamaam, located in the Yasmina
            quarter, was built in the 19th century.
            
            In the old city you will find shops that produce the olive oil soap and some agricultural products such as cheese and
            thyme. As well there is one of the most old, famous and delicious sweet shops in Palestine that offers knafeh, which is
