        <h1>Japan ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ</h1>
        <p>Japan is an island country in East Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean off the northeast coast of the Asian
            mainland,
            it is bordered to the west by the Sea of Japan and extends from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East
            China Sea in
            the south. The Japanese archipelago consists of four major islands alongside 14,121 smaller islands,
            covering 377,975
            square kilometers (145,937 sq mi). Divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions,
            about 75%
            of the country's terrain is mountainous and heavily forested, concentrating its agriculture and highly
            urbanized
            population along its eastern coastal plains. With a population of over 123 million as of 2025, it is the
            11th most
            populous country. The country's capital and largest city is Tokyo.</p>

        <h2>Culture</h2>
        <p>Japanese popular culture
            Contemporary Japanese culture combines influences from Asia, Europe, and North America. Traditional Japanese
            arts
            include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords, and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki,
            noh, dance,
            and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen,
            Geisha, and
            games. Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible
            Cultural Properties
            and National Treasures. Twenty-two sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, eighteen of
            which
            are of cultural significance. Japan is considered a cultural superpower.</p>
